# Baseball App

Youth baseball team management app for tracking field positions, batting orders, and game scores during a season.

## Tech Stack
- React 19 + Vite 8
- Firebase Firestore for real-time multi-device sync
- No router — tab-based navigation managed in App.jsx state
- All state persisted to Firestore (real-time sync) + localStorage (offline cache) via `useAppData()` hook
- Drag-and-drop via @dnd-kit (core + sortable)
- Coach PIN: 999 (protects undo, innings, absent, reset, etc.)

## Running
```bash
npm run dev     # Vite dev server (base: /baseball-app/)
npm run build   # Production build to dist/
```

## Firebase Cloud Sync (Multi-Device)

### Architecture
```
App() → checks for team code in localStorage
  ├── No code → TeamCodeScreen (Create Team / Join Team)
  └── Has code → MainApp()
        └── useAppData() → Firestore real-time sync + localStorage offline cache
```

### How It Works
- **Create Team**: Generates random 8-char code (e.g., `KFWN-8X3P`), creates Firestore doc at `teams/{code}`
- **Join Team**: Enter code → fetches Firestore doc → syncs in real-time
- **Real-time sync**: `onSnapshot()` listens for remote changes, `setDoc()` pushes local changes
- **Offline support**: `enableIndexedDbPersistence` + localStorage cache — app works without wifi, syncs when reconnected
- **No user accounts**: Team codes + coach PIN (999) — no auth needed
- **Loop prevention**: `isRemoteUpdate` ref flag prevents Firestore→local→Firestore infinite loops
- Team code stored in localStorage under key `baseball_team_code`
- All team data stored in Firestore under `teams/{teamCode}` document

### Firebase Project
- Project: `baseball-app-2625c`
- Firestore location: Los Angeles
- Plan: Spark (free)
- Security rules: Test mode (open read/write for 30 days from setup)

### Key Files
- `src/firebase.js` — Firebase config + Firestore init + offline persistence
- `src/hooks/useLocalStorage.js` — `useAppData()` with Firestore sync, exports: `generateTeamCode()`, `getStoredTeamCode()`, `setStoredTeamCode()`, `clearStoredTeamCode()`
- `src/components/TeamCodeScreen.jsx` — Create/Join team landing page
- `src/App.jsx` — `App()` wrapper checks team code, `MainApp()` has all game logic

## Key Architecture Decisions
- **Single data object**: All app state lives in one object synced to Firestore + cached in localStorage under key `baseball_app_data`
- **Undo system**: `updateData()` pushes previous state to an undo stack; undo is PIN-protected
- **Game setup flow**: Select game → Home/Away picker → Batting order setup → Position wizard → Auto-route to field (home) or batting (away)
- **Away team end-of-game**: After top of 6th batting → `awaitingFinalFielding` flag → field view for bottom of 6th → End Game button
- **Mid-game Mark Absent**: PIN-protected, removes from battingOrder + field positions + bench, recalculates `nextBatterIndex` by ID lookup, tracked in `absentIds` array
- **Reset Game**: PIN-protected, erases all game data for the active game, returns to game select
- **11 field positions**: P, C, 1B, 2B, SS, 3B, LF, LCF, CF, RCF, RF (youth league uses 4 outfielders)
- **6 innings per game**
- **Schedule**: Loaded from schedule.json, season runs Mar–May 2026

## Deployment
- GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions (deploy workflow on main branch)
- Base URL: `/baseball-app/`

## Status: Firebase Sync READY but NOT YET DEPLOYED
All Firebase code is written, config is plugged in, build passes. **NOT committed/pushed yet** — user wants to deploy after game day (2026-03-19). When ready:
1. `git add` all changed files
2. `git commit` with Firebase sync message
3. `git push` → GitHub Actions deploys to Pages
4. First visit will show "Create Team" / "Join Team" screen
5. Existing localStorage data will need to be uploaded to the new Firestore team doc on first create

## Recent Changes (latest first)
- Firebase Cloud Sync: Firestore real-time sync, team codes, TeamCodeScreen, offline persistence (code ready, not deployed)
- PIN-protected "Reset Game" button — erases all game data if coach selected wrong team
- Wider field layout (620×400 viewBox) so all positions fit on iPad without scrolling
- PIN-protected inning ◀/▶ arrows so kids can't accidentally change innings
- Mid-game "Mark Absent" feature (PIN-protected) — removes player from batting order, field positions, and bench
- Bigger field view: larger player chips (110×64), bigger fonts for sunlight readability
- Fixed away team game flow: after top of 6th → field view for bottom of 6th → End Game button
- Fixed home team End Game button not clickable (GameOverModal was outside early return)
- Fixed score display showing raw \u2013 escape instead of en-dash
- PIN-protected game cancel/uncancel buttons
- W/L results in green/red on Today's Game and Team Setup tabs
- Made Import Schedule button prominent when no games exist
- Added schedule import, game-over flow, and W/L tracking
- Added GitHub Pages deployment workflow
- Initial commit
